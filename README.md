# rpgame

I'm trying to learn (and experiment with) TDD using this project.

Basically I'm trying to write a simple ASCII RPG game. Other than that, I have no plan. I also have no experience writing games, so only peek into the codebase at your own risk.

My method is to try to write a failing test and then write an implementation. And see where that takes me.

---

**Note**: I'm trying to keep the code fairly clean but also trying to follow the "don't write more than to pass a failing test" rule. As a result, there's some weird duplication etc. As of now, it's not something I would be comfortable merging to a real codebase.

## Some magic commands

To run tests:
`make test`

To run pre-commit hooks:
`make pre-commit`
